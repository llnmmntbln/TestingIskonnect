                <p>
                    Consent to Electronic Disclosures and Notices: By registering for an account, you agree that such
                    registration constitutes your electronic signature, and you consent to the electronic provision of
                    all disclosures and notices from us including those required by law. You also agree that your
                    electronic signature will have the same legal effect as a physical signature. Methods of Delivery:
                    You agree that we can provide notices about the e-Services to you through our website or by email or
                    text messages to your registered and authorized contact details. Notices may include notifications
                    about your account, changes to the e-Services, or other information we are required to provide to
                    you. You also agree that electronic delivery of a notice has the same legal effect as if have been
                    provided with a physical copy of the same. We will consider that the notice has been received by you
                    within 24 hours from the time the notice was either posted to our website or emailed to you. We
                    shall not liable for your non-receipt of notices due to network outage, power outage, device loss,
                    device incompatibility, incorrect contact details provided, network and/or firewall restrictions,
                    and other issues which are beyond our control. Text Messages: You authorize us to provide you
                    notices via text message to allow us to verify you or your representative’s control over your
                    account (such as through two-step verification), and to provide you with other critical information
                    about your account. Standard text or data charges may apply to such notices. Where offered, you may
                    disable text message notifications by responding to any such message with “STOP”, or by following
                    instructions provided in the message. However, by disabling text messaging, you may be disabling
                    important security controls (as defined below) on your account and may increase the risk of loss to
                    your business.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 0;">
                    Requirements for Delivery: It should come as no surprise to you that you will need a computer or
                    mobile device, internet connectivity, and an updated web browser to access the e-Services and review
                    the notices provided to you.
                    <br><br>
                    Withdrawing Consent: Due to the nature of the e-Services, you will not be able to begin using the
                    e-Services without agreeing to electronic delivery of notices. However, you may choose to withdraw
                    your consent to receive notices electronically by terminating your Account.
